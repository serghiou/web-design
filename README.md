# Web Design

<div align="justify">

All of my resources on web design.

## Websites for building websites.

* Webflow
* WIX
* WordPress

## Frameworks

* **[Bootstrap.](https://getbootstrap.com/)** Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Bootstrap is completely free to download and use! Use that website to download Bootstrap, view examples, access themes or even contribute to its development. w3schools offers an excellent tutorial on Bootstrap 4 [here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp).

* **[MDBootstrap.](https://mdbootstrap.com/)** This is another version of Bootstrap, which prioritizes the material design - it has excellent and beautifully-looking graphics.

* **[HTML5UP.](https://html5up.net/)** Fantastically pretty templates to build a professionally-looking stylish website. These tend to be primarily suited for single-page websites, but not necessarily.

## CSS

* **[Vertical alignment.](https://www.sitepoint.com/atoz-css-screencast-vertical/)** Tutorial. A very good explanation of how to vertically align a block of let's say text with a picture in line.

## Themes that I like

* **[Future Imperfect.](https://html5up.net/future-imperfect)** By HTML5UP.
* **[Milton.](http://milton-template.webflow.io/)** By Webflow.
